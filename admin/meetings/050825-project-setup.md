## Questions, Concerns, Ideas, Misc.

- What do we do with the information after we've gathered it?\
**Answer:** in the `admin/adr` folder, create a new `.md` file detailing what you've researched, why we should choose one technology over the other (your rationale), how it fits the project we are building, how it addresses user concerns, etc.
