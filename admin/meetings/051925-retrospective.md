## Sprint Retrospective:

- We chose to hold the sprint retrospective in the format of the Four Ls method because we felt that it was the easiest way to gather feedback, as well as focus on fixes in preparation for our next sprint.

- Liked Items - anything appreciated in the sprint/made sprint successful:
  
  - Clear assignments with issue cards already made and linked to GitHub users. This allows us to branch off of those issues and ensure that we are closing them, making it easier to roll back to earlier builds if there are problems.
  - Pair programming: Groups of 2 worked on programming tasks, allowing more intensive backend tasks to be completed closer to schedule. Also allowed developers to collaborate on solving programming roadblocks.
  - Stand-Up Meetings every 2 days allowed for more work to get done quickly so meaningful updates could be given. Roadblocks section added.

- Lacked Items - things that could have brought the team closer to success:
  
  - Making a list of which items were blocking others, so we can schedule timelines according to task order. This would allow each team adequate time to complete their work.
  - Backend tasks were not always clear on what needed to get done or pushed. This was especially true with the CI/CD pipeline task — members weren’t sure whether they should only write the ADR or also implement the tool in the pipeline.

- Learned Items - lessons learned:
  
  - Good to pull from the issue created so that the branch will update and close the issue. This was especially useful when rolling back a feature after an update caused a build failure.
  - Pair programming improves code efficiency and fosters collaboration between experienced and less experienced developers, leading to quicker resolution of logic flaws or bugs.

- Longed For Items - things we desire for success/morale next sprint:
  
  - Reminder messages for teams about upcoming deadlines and work that needs to get done.
  - Ask more questions in Slack well ahead of deadlines to clear confusion early and avoid downstream delays caused by dependencies between teams.

## Concluding Thoughts

- We will attempt to implement the learned items to resolve any lacking items. Longed-for items can be addressed through the solutions we brainstormed or overlap with the learned items. We’ll implement these solutions and review progress after the next sprint.
