## Agenda:

1. Sprint retrospective
2. Discuss Sprint Status Video

## Sprint Retrospective:
- We chose to hold the sprint retrospective in the format of the Four Ls method because we felt that it was the easiest way to gather feedback, as well focus on fixes in preparation for our next sprint.
- Liked Items - anything appreciated in the sprint/made sprint successful:
  - Clear assignments with issue cards already made and linked to GitHub users. This allows for us to branch off of that issues and ensure that we are closing issues, making it easier to rollback to earlier builds if there are issues.
  - Pair programming: Groups of 2 worked on programming tasks, allowing for more intensive backend tasks to be completed closer to schedule. Also allowed developers to work together to figure out programming roadblocks.
  - Stand-Up Meetings every 2 days, allowed for more work to get done in a short period of time so that meaningful updates could be given. Roadblocks section added.

- Lacked Items - things that could have brought the team closer to success:
  - Making a list of what items were blocking one another, so that we can schedule timelines in accordance to order of task completion. This would allow each team to have adequate time to do their tasks.
  - Backend tasks were not always certain of what work needed to get done or pushed. We noticed this issue especially with regards to the CI/CD pipeline task, with members not sure if they should simply write the ADR comparing and contrasting their research, or if they should also implement the tool in the pipeline.

- Learned Items - lessons learned:
  - Good to pull from the issue created so that the branch will update and close the issue. This was especially useful when we needed to roll-back a feature after an update caused a build failure. Since it was linked to the issue, we did not have to go searching for the previous branch and were able to revert to an older branch instead of pushing buggy code.
  - Good to set-up pair programming, allows for greater efficiency in writing code, and encourages members to work together to share knowledge, especially because we have many programmers experienced in JavaScript/HTML/CSS, as well as a good number of individuals who are new to WebDev. This also allows for greater discussion so that any logic flaws or bugs in the code can get resolved quickly, creating better code pushes.

- Longed For Items - things we desire for success/morale next sprint:
  - Reminder messages for teams on what work needs to get done so that all teams are aware of deadlines coming up, as well as when they can begin working.
  - Asking more questions in Slack for clarification well in advance to deadlines so we are able to help one another clear any confusion before issues arise. This will also ensure that the needs of all teams are met, since the tasks of one team tend to impact the timeline of another.

## Concluding Thoughts
- Will attempt to implement the learned items to resolve any lacking items. Longed for items can be resolved through the fixes we have come up with, or are resolved by the learned items brainstorming. We will implement these solutions and once again touch base after the next/upcoming sprint.
