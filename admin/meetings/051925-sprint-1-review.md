## Agenda:

1. Sprint reflection
2. Daily stand-up

## Sprint Reflection:

- Open discussion on what went well during the last sprint:
  - Clear assignment of tasks amongst members - Each member knew what needed to be accomplished, by what date and time, and was able to give better stand-up updates as a result
  - Stand-up meetings moved from every day to every 2 days, which allowed people to have more updates to share, rather than empty posts.
  - More brainstorming as a group: Beginning the sprint planning session with open brainstorming allowed all members to contribute equally, as well as provided an opportunity to ask questions and clarification on topics they didn't understand, especially because our project idea requires some background knowledge understanding.

- Open discussion on what did NOT go well during the last sprint:
  - Not always clear what needed to get done in certain tasks with the backend. Individuals not sure about whether or not they should only provide ADR or commit code files.
  - Pull Requests not connected to issues: Members merging but not closing issues, leading to difficulty rolling back branches for certain feature corruption.
  - Missing deadlines for project items that relied on one another. Some components relied on another piece being completed first, but the same or close deadlines were set for both, resulting in the second item not being able to begin work until the first issue was resolved.

## Concluding Thoughts

- Overall, successful sprint. A good amount of background work was completed, there was an increased familiarity with branching, testing, and pipeline procedures. We will re-group with fixes to the aforementioned discussion on what did not go well during the sprint, and further elaborate on these suggestions during our retrospective.
