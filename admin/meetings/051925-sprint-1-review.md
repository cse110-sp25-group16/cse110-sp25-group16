## Agenda:

1. Sprint reflection
2. Daily stand-up

## Sprint Reflection:

- Open discussion on what went well during the last sprint:
  - Clear assignment of tasks amongst members - Each member knew what needed to be accomplished, by what date and time, and was able to give better stand-up updates as a result.
  - Stand-up meetings moved from every day to every 2 days, which allowed people to have more updates to share, rather than empty posts.
  - More brainstorming as a group: Beginning the sprint planning session with open brainstorming allowed all members to contribute equally, as well as provided an opportunity to ask questions and get clarification on topics they didn't understand — especially because our project idea requires some background knowledge.

- Open discussion on what did NOT go well during the last sprint:
  - Not always clear what needed to get done in certain tasks with the backend. Individuals weren’t sure whether they should only provide ADRs or also commit code files.
  - Pull Requests not connected to issues: Members merged code but did not close issues, leading to difficulty rolling back branches when features broke.
  - Missing deadlines for interdependent project items. Components relying on another to be finished were assigned similar deadlines, causing delays.

## Concluding Thoughts

- Overall, a successful sprint. A good amount of foundational work was completed. Team members grew more familiar with branching, testing, and pipeline procedures. We will regroup and implement solutions based on today’s reflections and revisit these topics in the retrospective.
