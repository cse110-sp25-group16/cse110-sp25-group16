## Agenda:

1. Sprint retrospective
2. Discuss Current Sprint Status

## Sprint Retrospective:

- We chose to hold the sprint retrospective in the format of the Four Ls method because we felt that it was the easiest way to gather feedback, as well focus on fixes in preparation for our next sprint.

- Liked Items - anything appreciated in the sprint/made sprint successful:

  - Increased testing to ensure unity & compatibility across different tasks by team members

- Lacked Items - things that could have brought the team closer to success:

  - General slow progress during this sprint, due to external factors

- Learned Items - lessons learned:

  - Try to have more consistent communication throughout the sprint to stay on track

- Longed For Items - things we desire for success/morale next sprint:
  - Have more team bonding sessions to help build team trust, psychological safety, and understanding

## Concluding Thoughts

- Will attempt to implement the learned items to resolve any lacking items. Longed for items can be resolved through the fixes we have come up with, or are resolved by the learned items brainstorming. We will implement these solutions and once again touch base after the next/upcoming sprint.
