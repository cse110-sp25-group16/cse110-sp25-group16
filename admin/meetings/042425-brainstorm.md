Tarot card app

- Ask a question feature based on card reading  
- Costar app \- astrology app, you can see your friend’s daily horoscopes  
- Dimensional app \- personalities, MBTI, etc.  
- friend comparison or “spiritual compatibility” feature. Like the app ask question every day, and test your mbti, mood and luckiness or something, and math you with someone in your list, said that you two are best matched today, hang outs together

## What problem are we trying to solve

There is no centralized space for tarot, horoscope, personality analysis even though these interests tend to overlap. This is an enhanced/more comprehensive way of profiling your personality by combining multiple different things. By creating a platform for discussion of divination and personal identity, we can facilitate more social and interpersonally-educational interactions.

## App Main Idea

You can build a profile based on your MBTI personality (INFP, ENTP, etc.), your horoscope, and every day we generate a tarot card reading. You can share your readings & horoscope predictions with friends.

## SWOT Analysis  
### Strengths:   
- Integrates tarot, astrology and MBTI which has not been seen between similar apps.
- Ability to connect and share readings with friends which encourages daily engagement
- Daily Tarot pulls and horoscope updates create a reason for users to return
### Weaknesses:
- Most likely only attracts people who are already interested in tarot/astrology/MBTI, limiting the user base
- Having tarot, astrology, and MBTI could overwhelm users if not designed cleanly
- Very strong competition from apps like Co-star and Sanctuary which already trusted platforms in astrology. Labyrinthos is strong for tarot.
### Opportunities:
- No other app fully integrates and merges MBTI, tarot and astrology. This makes it stand out
- Daily streaks could keep users engaged long term
- Rising interest in spirituality
### Threats:
- Market Saturation: Many astrology and tarot already exist so standing out requires a good UI and a clear hook
- Spirtuality and astrology are popular now but trends can potentially shift, which may affect user interest long-term

## Similar Applications

\-Co-star: Astrological charts personalized, daily horoscopes, can compare and match with friends. 

\-Sanctuary Psychic Readings:  Daily horoscope readings, live astrology, tarot, and psychic readings, birth chart insights,  astrology content and lessons, lots of lessons about psychic things

\-Labyrinthos Tarot reading: Daily tarot card readings with custom notification reminders. A journal to save past card readings. Multiple decks with different readings and backgrounds.

Why are we better?69

General overview: 78 Cards, each with a meaning as a tool for introspection and reflection, on past, present and future. These 78 are split into two types: 22 Major Arcana and 56 Minor Arcana. A Major Arcana is a significant card, and usually encompasses broad themes. A Minor Arcana is more specific and usually focuses on daily life. Minor Arcana consist of wands, cups, swords, and pentacles. Within these suits, each has a court card: King, Queen, Knight, and Page. 

To get a reading, shuffle the deck. Spreads can occur in the following amounts: 1, 3, 5, and 10\. In special instances, all 78 can be used.

* 1 card spread: General Overview  
* 3 card spread: Past, Present, Future  
* 5 card spread: More details in the 3 card spread  
  * Card 1: What is happening at the moment?  
  * Card 2: How can I weather it easily and with grace?  
  * Card 3: What is the lesson?  
  * Card 4: What is leaving at this time?  
  * Card 5: What is arriving at this time?  
* 10 card spread: Also known as Celtic Cross, the most comprehensive

Each card is then open to interpretation based on its attributes.
