# Sprint 2 Review Meeting

- Date: 5/25/25
- Purpose: Review the past sprint held

## Attendees:

- **Present:** Tyler Hoang, Anusha Rao, Minjoo O, Aiden Krueger, Leonard Shi, Ria Singhania, Angelica Cabusi, Nikhil Akiti, Dustin Nguyen, Anthony Georgis
- **Excused:** None

## Agenda:

1. Sprint reflection
2. Daily stand-up

## Sprint Reflection:

- Open discussion on what went well during the last sprint:

  - Team collaboration was smooth, everyone was able to work together and complete their pair programming tasks
  - Stand-up meetings moved from every day to every 2 days, which allowed people to have more updates to share, rather than empty posts.
  - More brainstorming as a group: Clarified any misconceptions through discussion at sprint
  - Issues brainstormed in advance be leads, with members adding any they noted during the sprint planning meeting
  - Automated testing reduced or caught any deployment bugs

- Open discussion on what did NOT go well during the last sprint:
  - Sprint Reflection was delayed by a day in submission due to sprint going long. We will remedy this by noting deadlines in advance, and we have planned to end the sprints in advance of the deadline.

## Concluding Thoughts

- Overall, successful sprint. Most all of the spec sheets are completed, allowing for a lot of background work to be clarified, making implementation easier. Wireframes, ADRs, and spec sheets reviewed with team so any misconceptions are clarified, or new features are brainstormed.

## Questions, Concerns, Ideas, Misc.
