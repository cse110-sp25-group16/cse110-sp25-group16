## Sprint Reflection:

- Open discussion on what went well during the last sprint:

  - Team collaboration was smooth, everyone was able to work together and complete their pair programming tasks
  - A good amount of backend and front end work was completed. We also were able to narrow our scope to more reasonable goals, focusing our resources on improving what we had (Quality over Quantity).

- Open discussion on what did NOT go well during the last sprint:
  - Multiple people were put on the same task, such as 3 people working on archive page, making some work redundant when their time could have been better spent on other pending issues.

## Concluding Thoughts

- Overall, successful sprint. We completed the goals we set out to acheive, had carefully documented research for our design decisions, and focused on making a well-developed, user-centric application!

## Questions, Concerns, Ideas, Misc.
