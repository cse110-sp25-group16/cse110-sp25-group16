- **Excused:** None

## Agenda:

1. Sprint retrospective
2. Discuss Current Sprint Status

## Sprint Retrospective:

- We chose to hold the sprint retrospective in the format of the Four Ls method because we felt that it was the easiest way to gather feedback, as well focus on fixes in preparation for our next sprint.

- Liked Items - anything appreciated in the sprint/made sprint successful:

  - Issue cards made and linked to GitHub users. This allows for us to branch off of that issues and ensure that we are closing issues, making it easier to rollback to earlier builds if there are issues. Also good to see deadlines for when tasks are due, so that each individual knows when their part is due and it does not hold up others parts.
  - Stand-Up Meetings every 2 days, allowed for more work to get done in a short period of time so that meaningful updates could be given. Roadblocks section added.
  - All tasks completed on time and on schedule, allowed us to discuss and clear up any confusion prior to sprint meeting.

- Lacked Items - things that could have brought the team closer to success:

  - Backend tasks were not always certain of what work needed to get done or pushed. We noticed this issue especially with regards to the CI/CD pipeline task, with members not sure if they should simply write the ADR comparing and contrasting their research, or if they should also implement the tool in the pipeline.
  - Unclear responsibilities caused delays, more thorough descriptions in issue cards so that tasks have clear direction.

- Learned Items - lessons learned:

  - Staying up-to-date on class deadlines and projects, such as when Sprint Reflections and Retrospectives are due, as well as more information on the CI/CD pipeline.

- Longed For Items - things we desire for success/morale next sprint:

  - Reminder messages for teams about upcoming deadlines and work that needs to get done.
  - More detailed slack updates on progress, more frequent pushes so there is a clear understanding of where each task stands

## Concluding Thoughts

- Will attempt to implement the learned items to resolve any lacking items. Longed for items can be resolved through the fixes we have come up with, or are resolved by the learned items brainstorming. We will implement these solutions and once again touch base after the next/upcoming sprint.
