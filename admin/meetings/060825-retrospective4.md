- Date: 6/8/25
- Purpose: Retrospective Meeting on Sprint 4

## Attendees:

- **Present:** Tyler Hoang, Anusha Rao, Minjoo O, Aiden Krueger, Leonard Shi, Ria Singhania, Angelica Cabusi, Nikhil Akiti, Dustin Nguyen, Anthony Georgis
- **Excused:** None

## Agenda:

1. Sprint retrospective
2. Discuss Current Sprint Status

## Sprint Retrospective:

- We chose to hold the sprint retrospective in the format of the Four Ls method because we felt that it was the easiest way to gather feedback, as well focus on fixes in preparation for our next sprint.

- Liked Items - anything appreciated in the sprint/made sprint successful:

  - We liked being able to merge our pair programming with group programming. For ex. the testing team was able to work with the frontend and backend teams for specific pages to ensure greater success.

- Lacked Items - things that could have brought the team closer to success:

  - We were not aware of the Sunday code freeze deadline, so it forced our carefully organized plans to be a bit scattered. Groups had much less time than anticipated to complete their parts.

- Learned Items - lessons learned:

  - Try to put more communication in main channels and out of group chats so that the entire team is aware of deadlines and current work going on.

- Longed For Items - things we desire for success/morale next sprint:

  - Greater time for team meetings and more in-person coding sprints so that there are fewer miscommunictions.

## Concluding Thoughts

- As this is our final sprint, we think we have pretty consistently addressed our lacking and longed for items. While we still had some shortcomings this sprint, it was mainly due to a miscommunication as we were not aware that there was a code freeze on Sunday, which resulted in our deadlines being pushed forward significantly. Yet, we still maintained clear communication, meeting again to update our sprint planning, and continuing on until we had a successful sprint!
