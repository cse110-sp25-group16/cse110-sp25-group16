## Code Style Enforcement

## Code Quality via Tool
- **Tools Considered:**  
  - *Codacy*  
  - *CodeClimate*
  - *SonarCloud*

- **Why Codacy was chosen:**
  - Front-end focused tool, supports JavaScript, HTML, and CSS out of the box
  - Ideal for small class projects with a strong emphasis on UI/UX
  - Integrates smoothly with GitHub â€“ provides inline feedback on pull requests
  - Customizable linting rules to enforce code style and consistency across the team
  - Free for public repositories, making it budget-friendly for student use
  - Requires minimal setup, making it easier for newer developers to adopt
  - Helps enforce quality and maintainability in a design-heavy codebase

- **Fit for Our Project:**
  - Project prioritizes aesthetic appeal and user experience over backend logic
  - Majority of team is focused on front-end development
  - Helps maintain clean, accessible, and well-styled code in a collaborative setting
  - Ensures a consistent coding standard across UI components

## E2E & Pixel Testing
- In general, we will not be using E2E or pixel testing in our pipeline, and we will only consider it when we are very late into the project build
- E2E testing can be very brittle, and in the early stages of the product where UI changes are constantly happening, having to rewrite tests any time we make a change is likely to cause more inefficiency than not.
- "Feel the pain, automate" - focus on when UI testing becomes cumbersome before beginning writing UI tests.
- However, we have identified the following libraries as potentially used when we do decide to implement E2E/pixel testing:
- - Playwright - powerful in cross-browser tests, and can be used on shadow DOM to test web components
- - Percy - has Playwright integration, Github Action integration, and is used for detecting visual changes in UI updates
- Once we reconvene on this topic at a later time, we may decide that E2E testing is feasible and decide to integrate it into our project.
