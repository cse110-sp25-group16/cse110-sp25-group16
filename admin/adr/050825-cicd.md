#### Unit Testing Framework Decision

### Purpose

 Unit testing ensures that individual components function as expected and plays a critical role in Agile and DevOps methodologies. In this docuement, I will disccuss the potential testing framework and reasons for the final decision

### Candidate Frameworks

### 1. **Jest**

* **Overview:** Jest is an all-in-one testing framework developed by Meta. It supports unit testing, mocking, coverage reporting, and snapshot testing out of the box.
* **Pros:**

  * Built-in assertion, mocking, and test runner
  * Excellent documentation and large community
  * Fast test execution with parallelization
  * Snapshot testing support
  * Easy integration with GitHub Actions
  * Maintained by Meta and frequently updated
* **Cons:**

  * Slightly slower startup on large projects compared to lighter tools
  * Snapshot testing can be misused if not reviewed properly
* **Reference:** [https://jestjs.io/](https://jestjs.io/)

### 2. **Mocha + Chai**

* **Overview:** Mocha is a flexible testing framework that can be paired with various assertion libraries like Chai. It’s known for its configurability and long-term use in Node.js environments.
* **Pros:**

  * Modular and customizable
  * Mature and battle-tested
  * Works well with BDD and TDD styles
* **Cons:**

  * Requires extra configuration (e.g., Chai, Sinon)
  * No built-in mocking or coverage reporting
* **Reference:** [https://mochajs.org/](https://mochajs.org/) | [https://www.chaijs.com/](https://www.chaijs.com/)

### 3. **Tape**

* **Overview:** Tape is a minimalist test runner that runs tests sequentially and exits cleanly. It emphasizes simplicity and clarity.
* **Pros:**

  * Lightweight and minimal
  * No global variables; easy to reason about
  * Suitable for small projects
* **Cons:**

  * No built-in mocking, assertions, or reporting tools
  * Limited plugin ecosystem
* **Reference:** [https://github.com/ljharb/tape](https://github.com/ljharb/tape)

### 4. **Ava**

* **Overview:** Ava is a fast test runner that runs tests concurrently. It’s designed for performance and simplicity.
* **Pros:**

  * Built-in support for async/await
  * Concurrent test execution improves speed
  * Clean and minimal API
* **Cons:**

  * Lacks built-in mocking and browser support
  * Poorer IDE integration and debugging support

### Decision

After evaluating the above options, we selected **Jest** as the unit testing framework for our project.

### Rationale:

* **Ecosystem Fit:** Works with both frontend and backend JavaScript code
* **Automation:** Integrates cleanly with GitHub Actions for CI
* **Developer Experience:** Well-documented, great error messages, and easy to use
* **Extensibility:** Supports future needs like code coverage and snapshot tests

### Implementation Plan

1. Add Jest to `package.json`:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest
   ```
2. Add test script:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "test": "jest"
   }
   ```
3. Create sample test file:

   ```js
   // sum.js
   export function sum(a, b) {
     return a + b;
   }

   // sum.test.js
   import { sum } from './sum';

   test('adds 2 + 3 to equal 5', () => {
     expect(sum(2, 3)).toBe(5);
   });
   ```
4. Add GitHub Actions workflow to run Jest:

   ```yaml
   name: CI

   on: [push, pull_request]

   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - name: Setup Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v3
           with:
             node-version: '18'
         - run: npm install
         - run: npm run test
   ```

### Conclusion

Jest provides a reliable, modern, and feature-complete solution for unit testing in JavaScript environments. Its strong community backing, zero-config setup, and extensibility make it ideal for integrating into our CI/CD pipeline during Phase 1 and beyond.
