## Document Generation via Automation
- Using JSDocs for our project since it is simple, creates easy-to-navigate documentation in a separate HTML file, and was made for JavaScript.
- The other libraries, like TypeDoc and Sphinx, wouldn't help with our project since we will mainly be using JavaScript. Another library I saw was Doxygen, but I don't think it would fit our needs since it works best for projects that use multiple languages.
- Plus, JSDocs is perfect for small to medium-sized JavaScript projects, which accurately describes our project.
- We could also document our CSS with StyleDocco, but I wouldn't recommend it as it may cause clutter in our project.
