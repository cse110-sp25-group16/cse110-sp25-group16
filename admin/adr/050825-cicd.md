## E2E & Pixel Testing
- In general, we will not be using E2E or pixel testing in our pipeline, and we will only consider it when we are very late into the project build
- E2E testing can be very brittle, and in the early stages of the product where UI changes are constantly happening, having to rewrite tests any time we make a change is likely to cause more inefficiency than not.
- "Feel the pain, automate" - focus on when UI testing becomes cumbersome before beginning writing UI tests.
- However, we have identified the following libraries as potentially used when we do decide to implement E2E/pixel testing:
- - Playwright - powerful in cross-browser tests, and can be used on shadow DOM to test web components
- - Percy - has Playwright integration, Github Action integration, and is used for detecting visual changes in UI updates
- Once we reconvene on this topic at a later time, we may decide that E2E testing is feasible and decide to integrate it into our project.
