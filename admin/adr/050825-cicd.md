# CI/CD Aspects

## Code Style Enforcement

## Code Quality via Tool

- **Tools Considered:**  
  - *Codacy*  
  - *CodeClimate*
  - *SonarCloud*

- **Why Codacy was chosen:**
  - Front-end focused tool, supports JavaScript, HTML, and CSS out of the box
  - Ideal for small class projects with a strong emphasis on UI/UX
  - Integrates smoothly with GitHub â€“ provides inline feedback on pull requests
  - Customizable linting rules to enforce code style and consistency across the team
  - Free for public repositories, making it budget-friendly for student use
  - Requires minimal setup, making it easier for newer developers to adopt
  - Helps enforce quality and maintainability in a design-heavy codebase

- **Fit for Our Project:**
  - Project prioritizes aesthetic appeal and user experience over backend logic
  - Majority of team is focused on front-end development
  - Helps maintain clean, accessible, and well-styled code in a collaborative setting
  - Ensures a consistent coding standard across UI components

## Unit Tests via Automation

## Document Generation via Automation
- Using JSDocs for our project since it is simple, creates easy-to-navigate documentation in a separate HTML file, and was made for JavaScript.
- The other libraries, like TypeDoc and Sphinx, wouldn't help with our project since we will mainly be using JavaScript. Another library I saw was Doxygen, but I don't think it would fit our needs since it works best for projects that use multiple languages.
- Plus, JSDocs is perfect for small to medium-sized JavaScript projects, which accurately describes our project.
- We could also document our CSS with StyleDocco, but I wouldn't recommend it as it may cause clutter in our project.
- It is purely comment based so there is no need for compilation which would add extra overhead.

- The only cons to JSDocs is that it may be a little timeconsuming getting used to the parameters that are used to create the comments for JSDocs to work but other than that, it is a really simple program to get used to.

*Installation Process*
- All we need to do is run "npm install --save-dev jsdoc" and we will have it on our systems.

## E2E & Pixel Testing

- In general, we will not be using E2E or pixel testing in our pipeline, and we will only consider it when we are very late into the project build
- E2E testing can be very brittle, and in the early stages of the product where UI changes are constantly happening, having to rewrite tests any time we make a change is likely to cause more inefficiency than not.
- "Feel the pain, automate" - focus on when UI testing becomes cumbersome before beginning writing UI tests.
- However, we have identified the following libraries as potentially used when we do decide to implement E2E/pixel testing:
- - Playwright - powerful in cross-browser tests, and can be used on shadow DOM to test web components
- - Percy - has Playwright integration, Github Action integration, and is used for detecting visual changes in UI updates
- Once we reconvene on this topic at a later time, we may decide that E2E testing is feasible and decide to integrate it into our project.
