# Team Setup

- Rationale: Ideally, more frontend than backend for team organization
  - Focus on user experience, user-friendly UI, aesthetic appeal
  - This app is less "practical," more of a fun app, so the focus should be on the user experience over 100% efficient/robust API design and optimization

## Front-end
- Anusha Rao
- Dustin Nguyen
- Leonard Shi
- Aiden Krueger
- Angelica Cabusi
- Nikhil Akiti
- Ria Singhania

## Back-end
- Tyler Hoang
- Ria Singhania (specs only)
- Minjoo O
- Anthony Georgis

# Role definitions

- Rationale: We want concrete role definitions to encourage specialization, where each person may be masters of their domain
- Within each front-end & back-end category, we may have more concrete role breakdowns in the subteams themselves, for purpose of further specialization
- However, each team member should be comfortable with the content within their sub-team ("T-shaped") to ease collaboration 

## Front-end

- Handle user interface
- Design GUIs, focus on user stories & how user stories impact interface
- Web page structure
- Styling (think: fonts, colors, themes, shapes, motifs, responsiveness, animations)

## Back-end

- Logic for generating tarot card readings
- MBTI decisions*
- Logic for horoscope readings*
- Handling localStorage API, data
- Architecting class structures, etc.

\* depending on how much time we have remaining, we might have to limit scope of features
