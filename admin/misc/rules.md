# Team Rules

Revision: _05/08/2025_\
This document outlines not only the guidelines, but also the mindset that our team strives to accomplish & embody in the course of our work.

## Purpose & Objectives

- Create technology that is user-friendly with a low barrier of usage.
- Create functional technology that enriches the lives of its users.
- Always consider ethics, ex. in cases of privacy.
- Learn and improve both as developers and as people.

## Values & Standards

- _Communication is key! Follow these communication protocols:_
  - Maximum 16 hour response time on messages relevant to you.
  - When unable to meet deadlines or requiring help, try to notify the group 24+ hours in advance, or at minimum 12 hours in advance.
  - Try to acknowledge each other, even if it's just an emoji reaction, so that we always know we are on the same page.
  - Don't let questions build up - if you have a question, others probably do as well. Asking questions helps us be honest and keep a consensus!
- _Compassion enhances cooperation_
  - Be understanding of other's life situations.
  - Understand that we are all at different levels of developmental skill
  - Growth mindset - we all have a lot to learn from each other, and we should approach situations with a focus on learning.
  - Focus on solving problems, never assign blame to people, only systems
  - Never be afraid to ask questions or ask for help!
- _Quality-first development_
  - Always strive to follow best practices.
  - Minimize "code smells" & technical debt.
  - Choose technologies that have a sensible application & purpose to our project (rather than what's popular, cool, etc.).
  - Always document code.
  - Always use clear commit messages following [Conventional Commits Style](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- _Always strive for better!_
  - This is a living document, as we go we may choose to revise what standards and values we choose to embrace in order to improve our project.

## Roles & Responsibilities

- **Team leads:** delegate tasks, organize, maximize morale, coordinate multiple members and maintain a "pulse" on the team.
- **Developers:** self-manage & handle assigned tasks, maintain consistent communication on progress & problems.

## Accountability Structures

- **Bi-daily standups:** When to-do items remain, check in with your progress, blockers, and what you plan on doing next.
- **Values & standards:** Always uphold values & standards identified above.

## Potential Issues & Conflict Resolution

- Potential issues:

  - Missing deadlines
  - Poor communication
  - Development disagreements
  - Work allocation

- If a member finds themselves in violation of the standards or values set forth in the prior section we will:
  - _Ask:_ how can they improve or change their approach to better follow our standards and values?
  - _Ask:_ how can the group or other members also change or help in order to assist a member in following our standards and values?
  - _Ask:_ if this is a repeated issue, are our standards and values flawed and should we consider revising them?
  - _Act:_ implement changes as necessary.
- If a member feels like they are given an unfair amount of work, please contact your lead or bring it up in a group discussion and we can address & redistribute the workload accordingly
