**Consider methods for determining MBTI information**

- **Self-report questionnaire**

  - _Description:_ 8–12 forced-choice questions (condensed MBTI).
  - _Pros:_ High accuracy; no external dependency.
  - _Cons:_ Adds friction; survey fatigue; needs polished UX.

- **Import existing MBTI result**

  - _Description:_ User enters their 4-letter code or uploads a result from a reputable test.
  - _Pros:_ Near-zero friction if the user already knows their type.
  - _Cons:_ Depends on prior testing; prone to typos.

- **Hybrid approach**
  - _Description:_ Start with self-report and allow periodic optional check-ins to confirm or update the type.
  - _Pros:_ Balances accuracy and UX; no external services required.
  - _Cons:_ Slightly more implementation complexity; requires clear messaging.

**Brainstorm: ways to weave MBTI into the Tarot app**

- Offer Tarot spreads tailored to each personality type’s strengths.
- Add type-specific card notes (e.g., “As an INTJ, you might see this card as a strategic nudge”).
- Show a simple dashboard: your 4-letter type plus a log of past readings.
- Let users share readings with friends who have matching—or contrasting—types.
- Switch color themes or small bits of text (“micro-copy”) to match each type’s general vibe.
- Time notifications differently for planners vs. spontaneous types (e.g., send reminders earlier for “schedule-lovers,” later for “go-with-the-flow” folks).
- After each reading, ask “Did this hit home?”—the feedback helps fine-tune future suggestions.
