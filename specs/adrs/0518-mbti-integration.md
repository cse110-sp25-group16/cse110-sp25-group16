**Consider methods for determining MBTI information**

* **Self-report questionnaire**  
  * *Description:* 8–12 forced-choice questions (condensed MBTI).  
  * *Pros:* High accuracy; no external dependency.  
  * *Cons:* Adds friction; survey fatigue; needs polished UX.

* **Import existing MBTI result**  
  * *Description:* User enters their 4-letter code or uploads a result from a reputable test.  
  * *Pros:* Near-zero friction if the user already knows their type.  
  * *Cons:* Depends on prior testing; prone to typos.

* **Hybrid approach**  
  * *Description:* Start with self-report and allow periodic optional check-ins to confirm or update the type.  
  * *Pros:* Balances accuracy and UX; no external services required.  
  * *Cons:* Slightly more implementation complexity; requires clear messaging.

**Brainstorm: ways to weave MBTI into the Tarot app**

* Offer Tarot spreads tailored to each personality type’s strengths.  
* Add type-specific card notes (e.g., “As an INTJ, you might see this card as a strategic nudge”).  
* Show a simple dashboard: your 4-letter type plus a log of past readings.  
* Let users share readings with friends who have matching—or contrasting—types.  
* Switch color themes or small bits of text (“micro-copy”) to match each type’s general vibe.  
* Time notifications differently for planners vs. spontaneous types (e.g., send reminders earlier for “schedule-lovers,” later for “go-with-the-flow” folks).  
* After each reading, ask “Did this hit home?”—the feedback helps fine-tune future suggestions.
