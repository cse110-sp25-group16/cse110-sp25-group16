# Branching and Merging Strategies

## Context

In collaborative software development, a clear branching and merging strategy is essential for managing code changes, ensuring stability, and supporting different workflows such as feature development, bug fixing, continuous deployment, and release management. Choosing the right strategy depends on factors like team size, project complexity, deployment frequency, and whether the codebase supports multiple versions in production.

## Branching Strategies

### 1. Git Flow

- **Use Case**: Long-term projects with scheduled releases
- **Branches**:
  - `main`: Production-ready code
  - `develop`: Integration branch
  - `feature/*`: Feature development
  - `release/*`: Pre-release stabilization
  - `hotfix/*`: Emergency production fixes
- **Pros**: Clear role for each branch; well-suited for teams needing structured release processes.
- **Cons**: Heavyweight; slow for fast-moving or small teams.

### 2. GitHub Flow

- **Use Case**: Continuous deployment, small teams
- **Branches**:
  - `main`: Always deployable
  - `feature/*`: Short-lived feature branches
- **Workflow**:
  1. Branch from `main`
  2. Open PR early for feedback
  3. Merge after CI passes and review
- **Pros**: Simple and fast; works well with CI/CD.
- **Cons**: No explicit release or hotfix process.

---

### 3. Trunk-Based Development (GitLab Flow)

- **Use Case**: Agile teams with strong CI and feature flagging
- **Branches**:
  - `main` or `trunk`: Central development branch
  - Short-lived `feature/*` branches
- **Workflow**:
  - Feature branches are merged within 1–2 days.
  - Feature flags are used to control incomplete features.
- **Pros**: Rapid integration, simple history.
- **Cons**: Requires robust CI/testing and use of feature flags.

---

### 4. Release Branching

- **Use Case**: Supporting multiple versions (e.g., LTS, enterprise apps)
- **Branches**:
  - `main`: Latest development
  - `release/x.y`: Versioned releases
  - `feature/*`, `bugfix/*`: Support development
- **Pros**: Easy backporting and hotfixes per version.
- **Cons**: Requires careful syncing and discipline.

---

### 5. Environment-Based Branching

- **Use Case**: Teams with separate dev, QA, and production environments
- **Branches**:
  - `dev`, `qa`, `prod`: Aligned with deployment environments
- **Workflow**:
  - Merge features into `dev`
  - Promote `dev` → `qa` → `prod`
- **Pros**: Clear visibility of what’s deployed where.
- **Cons**: Can cause drift and merge overhead.

---

### 6. Forking Workflow

- **Use Case**: Open-source projects or teams with external contributors
- **Workflow**:
  - Contributors fork the main repo
  - Submit changes via pull requests
- **Pros**: Isolated, secure workflow
- **Cons**: Slower feedback loop, syncing challenges

---

## Merging Strategies

### 1. Merge Commits

- Uses `git merge` to bring changes together.
- **Pros**: Preserves full history and branch structure.
- **Cons**: Messier commit history.

### 2. Squash and Merge

- Combines all PR commits into a single commit.
- **Pros**: Clean history, easier to revert.
- **Cons**: Loses intermediate commit context.

### 3. Rebase and Merge

- Rewrites commit history to appear linear.
- **Pros**: Clean history, bisect-friendly.
- **Cons**: Can be confusing; not suitable for shared branches.

## Final Decision and Implementation

After evaluating our team size, CI/CD setup, and deployment needs, we will adopt a **GitHub Flow** strategy with **Squash and Merge** as our default PR merge method. This allows for:

- Simpler workflows and fewer long-lived branches
- Early feedback via pull requests
- Clean and readable commit history
- Fast iteration and continuous deployment

All contributors will branch from `main`, work in feature branches, and open pull requests early for review and CI. Feature branches will be short-lived (ideally <2 days), and feature flags will be used for incomplete or risky changes. Emergency fixes will be patched directly onto `main` and deployed immediately.

This strategy offers us a balance of speed, simplicity, and control, aligned with modern development practices.
