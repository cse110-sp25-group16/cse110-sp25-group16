# Dogfood Software Evaluation

## Signup

- I was able to input my full name, date of birth, and MBTI personality type.
- Inputting name, date of birth, and MBTI worked seamlessly.
- **Rating: 8/10** – Inputting information was smooth and gave a success notification.

### RFI (Request for Improvement)
- The success notification could be more aesthetically aligned with the app’s starry theme.
- Although the MBTI was fun to input, it’s currently not utilized in the app.

## Tarot Cards

- Successfully pulled 3, 5, or 10 cards, each with a visual depiction.
- Exporting the reading includes reasoning for each card, providing a holistic overview.
- Clicking on a turned card reveals more detailed info.

- **Rating: 7/10** – Visually engaging. The flipping animation added interactivity.

### RFI
- Consider adding one overarching description of the reading to help users interpret the results more effectively.

## Horoscope

- Based on my birthday, the app identified my sign (e.g., Aries with a Ram icon).
- Offered three horoscope dimensions: **Theme**, **Mood**, and **Advice**.
- Exporting capability allowed sharing of horoscope readings.

- **Rating: 7/10** – Similar strengths to Tarot. Segmenting into three aspects made the reading more applicable to daily life.

### RFI
- An overarching summary of the day across all three aspects would enhance clarity.
- More detailed descriptions under Theme, Mood, and Advice would be beneficial.

## Settings

- Allowed editing of any field for updates or multi-user access from the same device.

- **Rating: 9/10** – Clear purpose and user autonomy appreciated.

### RFI
