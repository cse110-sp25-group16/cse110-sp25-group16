# Issue Tracking

- Rationale: ideally, use issue tracking software that integrates well into rest of work's toolset & flow
- Also use tool that developers are familiar & comfortable with

- Researched issue tracking methods. Decided that Github Projects would be best as it doesn't require additional software and it integrates well into our current workflow.
- Researched/created story points method. Decided to create one using the fiboncci sequence using numbers 1 - very simple (< 1hr) , 2 - simple (1 - 2hr), 3 - small task with some complexity (~half day), 5 - medium tasks and requires collaboration (1 day), 8 - large tasks (1 - 2) days, and 13 - very complex (3+ days, should be broken down).
- Create issue labels for corresponding story point values, & try to allocate tasks such that each member does generally similar amounts of work
