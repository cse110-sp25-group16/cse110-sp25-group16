# CI/CD Aspects

## Code Style Enforcement

[ADR](./051025-Linting-Style.md)

## Code Quality via Tool

- **Tools Considered:**  
  - *Codacy*  
  - *CodeClimate*
  - *SonarCloud*

- **Why Codacy was chosen:**
  - Front-end focused tool, supports JavaScript, HTML, and CSS out of the box
  - Ideal for small class projects with a strong emphasis on UI/UX
  - Integrates smoothly with GitHub – provides inline feedback on pull requests
  - Customizable linting rules to enforce code style and consistency across the team
  - Free for public repositories, making it budget-friendly for student use
  - Requires minimal setup, making it easier for newer developers to adopt
  - Helps enforce quality and maintainability in a design-heavy codebase

- **Fit for Our Project:**
  - Project prioritizes aesthetic appeal and user experience over backend logic
  - Majority of team is focused on front-end development
  - Helps maintain clean, accessible, and well-styled code in a collaborative setting
  - Ensures a consistent coding standard across UI components

## Unit Tests via Automation

### Purpose

 Unit testing ensures that individual components function as expected and plays a critical role in Agile and DevOps methodologies. In this docuement, I will disccuss the potential testing framework and reasons for the final decision

### Candidate Frameworks

### 1. **Jest**

* **Overview:** Jest is an all-in-one testing framework developed by Meta. It supports unit testing, mocking, coverage reporting, and snapshot testing out of the box.
* **Pros:**

  * Built-in assertion, mocking, and test runner
  * Excellent documentation and large community
  * Fast test execution with parallelization
  * Snapshot testing support
  * Easy integration with GitHub Actions
  * Maintained by Meta and frequently updated
* **Cons:**

  * Slightly slower startup on large projects compared to lighter tools
  * Snapshot testing can be misused if not reviewed properly
* **Reference:** [https://jestjs.io/](https://jestjs.io/)

### 2. **Mocha + Chai**

* **Overview:** Mocha is a flexible testing framework that can be paired with various assertion libraries like Chai. It’s known for its configurability and long-term use in Node.js environments.
* **Pros:**

  * Modular and customizable
  * Mature and battle-tested
  * Works well with BDD and TDD styles
* **Cons:**

  * Requires extra configuration (e.g., Chai, Sinon)
  * No built-in mocking or coverage reporting
* **Reference:** [https://mochajs.org/](https://mochajs.org/) | [https://www.chaijs.com/](https://www.chaijs.com/)

### 3. **Tape**

* **Overview:** Tape is a minimalist test runner that runs tests sequentially and exits cleanly. It emphasizes simplicity and clarity.
* **Pros:**

  * Lightweight and minimal
  * No global variables; easy to reason about
  * Suitable for small projects
* **Cons:**

  * No built-in mocking, assertions, or reporting tools
  * Limited plugin ecosystem
* **Reference:** [https://github.com/ljharb/tape](https://github.com/ljharb/tape)

### 4. **Ava**

* **Overview:** Ava is a fast test runner that runs tests concurrently. It’s designed for performance and simplicity.
* **Pros:**

  * Built-in support for async/await
  * Concurrent test execution improves speed
  * Clean and minimal API
* **Cons:**

  * Lacks built-in mocking and browser support
  * Poorer IDE integration and debugging support

### Decision

After evaluating the above options, we selected **Jest** as the unit testing framework for our project.

### Rationale:

* **Ecosystem Fit:** Works with both frontend and backend JavaScript code
* **Automation:** Integrates cleanly with GitHub Actions for CI
* **Developer Experience:** Well-documented, great error messages, and easy to use
* **Extensibility:** Supports future needs like code coverage and snapshot tests

### Conclusion

Jest provides a reliable, modern, and feature-complete solution for unit testing in JavaScript environments. Its strong community backing, zero-config setup, and extensibility make it ideal for integrating into our CI/CD pipeline during Phase 1 and beyond.

## Document Generation via Automation
- Using JSDocs for our project since it is simple, creates easy-to-navigate documentation in a separate HTML file, and was made for JavaScript.
- The other libraries, like TypeDoc and Sphinx, wouldn't help with our project since we will mainly be using JavaScript. Another library I saw was Doxygen, but I don't think it would fit our needs since it works best for projects that use multiple languages.
- Plus, JSDocs is perfect for small to medium-sized JavaScript projects, which accurately describes our project.
- We could also document our CSS with StyleDocco, but I wouldn't recommend it as it may cause clutter in our project.
- It is purely comment based so there is no need for compilation which would add extra overhead.

- The only cons to JSDocs is that it may be a little timeconsuming getting used to the parameters that are used to create the comments for JSDocs to work but other than that, it is a really simple program to get used to.

*Installation Process*
- All we need to do is run "npm install --save-dev jsdoc" and we will have it on our systems.

## E2E & Pixel Testing

- In general, we will not be using E2E or pixel testing in our pipeline, and we will only consider it when we are very late into the project build
- E2E testing can be very brittle, and in the early stages of the product where UI changes are constantly happening, having to rewrite tests any time we make a change is likely to cause more inefficiency than not.
- "Feel the pain, automate" - focus on when UI testing becomes cumbersome before beginning writing UI tests.
- However, we have identified the following libraries as potentially used when we do decide to implement E2E/pixel testing:
- - Playwright - powerful in cross-browser tests, and can be used on shadow DOM to test web components
- - Percy - has Playwright integration, Github Action integration, and is used for detecting visual changes in UI updates
- Once we reconvene on this topic at a later time, we may decide that E2E testing is feasible and decide to integrate it into our project.
